# Gradient damage models as phase-field models of brittle fracture

We give here exemples of the numerical solution of the quasi-static evolution problem for gradient damage models, and show how they can be used to solve brittle fracture problems.

The codes depend on FEniCS 2018.1.0. To run it we suggest to follow one of the following solutions:
 - Use Google colab Notebooks
 - Use Docker containers provided by FEniCS developers, see here: https://fenicsproject.org/download/
