# Content 

This repository contains supporting material for the course Damage and Fracture at Sorbonne Universit√©.

- `notebook/VarFrac.ipynb`: A basic commented example for the finite element implementation of the phase-field models of fracture using FEniCS.

- `notebook/VI.ipynb`: A simple example on how to solve a Variational Inequality in FEniCS

- `notebook/Inclusion.ipynb`: The numerical solution of a nontrivial fracture problem using the phase-field approach

- `notebook/VI-notes.ipynb`: Some notes on variational inequalities

The code is currently based on the use of FEniCS 2018.1 and python3
